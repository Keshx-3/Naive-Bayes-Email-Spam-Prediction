# Spam Detection Using Naive Bayes

This project demonstrates a simple spam detection model using the Naive Bayes classifier in Python. The model is built using the `sklearn` library and trained on a dataset containing SMS messages labeled as "spam" or "ham" (not spam). The aim is to classify new messages as either spam or ham(not spam) based on the training data.

## Dataset

The dataset used is `spam.csv`, which contains two columns:
- `Category`: Indicates if the message is "spam" or "ham".
- `Message`: The content of the SMS message.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
